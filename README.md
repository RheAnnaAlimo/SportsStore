# SportsStore
This simple but realistic application is a completely functional online store.

Used MVC Framework development to create:

* online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page
* a shopping cart where users can add and remove products
* a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details
* administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for managing the catalog
* protection that allows only logged-in administrators to make changes
